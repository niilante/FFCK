## How to contribute to FFCK's project?

#### **Did you find a problem?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/FFCK/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/FFCK/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **sample** or an **test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is currently not occurring.


#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

* Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted.


#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and/or fixes.
