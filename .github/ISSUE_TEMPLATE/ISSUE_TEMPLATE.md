Do the checklist before filing an issue:

- [ ] Is this something you can **debug and fix**? Send a [pull request](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/FFCK/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)! Bug fixes and documentation fixes are welcome.
- [ ] Have a usage project related question or finding? Ask your question on [here](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/FFCK/issues/3).


None of the above, create a bug report
------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to add **all the information needed to understand the bug** so that someone can help. If the info is missing we'll add the 'Needs more information' label and close the issue until there is enough information.

- [ ] Provide a **minimal code snippet** / [rnplay](https://rnplay.org/) example that reproduces the bug. **DO NOT** post low effort tickets without any substantial back-links, **screenshots** are optional but overall **NOT WELCOME**, since no one should be forced to decipher it (_you can post screenshots if it helps and add more context to your question/problem/pull request_).
- [ ] What's the **version** of Firefox you're using?
- [ ] What's the OS? Are you using Mac, Linux or Windows?
- [ ] Does this occur on iOS, Android, Desktop or all three?
- [ ] **YOU MUST** include the revisions/commit revision in order to reproduce your issue and verify it.
